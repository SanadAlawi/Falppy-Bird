# Falppy-Bird

This Java game (made with Javafx canvas) is a classic take on the popular Flappy Bird game. Players start with a bird that must navigate through a series of obstacles to earn a higher score. The game is simple in concept but challenging in execution, requiring quick reflexes and a keen eye for detail. As the bird flies, colorful particles trail behind it, adding a visually striking element to the game.
